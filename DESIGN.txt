Project 1 Design Document


  First of all, I took out all the functions from my Functions class because all of them were
very object-oriented. Ultimately, I didn't place any functions in a central Functions
class as none really needed to be there.


 There was some functions where I was on the fence on to whether to place in which classes such
as the executeOctoFullActivity(), executeOctoNotFullActivity(), executeFishActivity(), etc.
These functions could have worked well in various classes like Entity, WorldModel, or even Action.
However, in the end I ended up placing them in the Entity class as I felt it made sense for an
entity to execute a specific function based on their kind. Functions like findNearest(),
nearestEntity(), nextPositionCrab(), and nextPositionOcto() all worked very closely with
attributes of both the Entity and WorldModel classes. They could have been equally as effectively
been placed in either. Ultimately, I placed them in WorldModel, becuase I viewed the Entity
objects as being controlled by the WorldModel.
